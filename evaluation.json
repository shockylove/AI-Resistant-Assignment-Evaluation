    },
    "counterfactual_need": {
      "score": 0,
      "rationale": "Tasks involve direct implementation and evaluation; no counterfactual reasoning or hypothetical 'why not' arguments are required."

      "rationale": "Only final deliverables (code, results folders, and a report) are requested; no interim drafts, outlines, or process checkpoints are required."
    },
    "retrievability": {
      "score": 10,
      "rationale": "The specialized use of CodeGen and EvalPlus for program synthesis makes direct retrieval of a complete solution from public sources unlikely."
    },
    "templatedness": {
      "score": 60,
      "rationale": "While following a common ML-homework structure (setup, implementation, evaluation, report), it includes specific tools and metrics, reducing but not eliminating formulaicity."
